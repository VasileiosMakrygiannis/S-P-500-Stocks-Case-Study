# S&P500 Stocks Project
This project was created after the successfull completion of the 8 series courses of the "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate".

I decided to proceed at the last optional course "Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study" because i knew it would give me a direct experience on the things i learned throughout the courses and i was able to use most of the tools that i learned and many more that i searched myself to create this outcome.

*Case Study*

You are a junior data analyst working for an Index Fund manager. You have been in your position for nearly six months, and your manager believes you are prepared to assume greater responsibility. He has requested that you lead a project, which encompasses defining the business objective through to presenting your data-driven recommendations. He has asked you to rank the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 Index based on their fastest revenue growth, along with their total EBITDA and trading volume. He aims to evaluate the potential for implementing a new strategy within the fund called "Value Investing", specifically targeting stocks within industries perceived as undervalued in the current time period.

**Business Task**: Rank the top 10 quickest revenue growth companies, their total EBIDTA and trading volume.

Deliverables: 
1) I documented all the process in R Studio with a R Markdown file which is executable (Knit) in a HTML format.
2) I used SQL Server Management Studio in order to manipulate the clean data with sql queries.
3) Finaly i created a dynamic visualization dashboard with Power BI to present and explain my findings.
