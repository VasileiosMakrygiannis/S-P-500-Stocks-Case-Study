# S&P500 Stocks Project
This project was developed by following the successful completion of the eight-course "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate" series.

I chose to undertake the optional "Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study" course because I wanted hands-on experience applying what I learned. This opportunity allowed me to use many of the tools covered in the courses, as well as additional resources I researched independently, to achieve this result.

*Case Study*

You are a junior data analyst working for an Index Fund manager. You have been in your position for nearly six months, and your manager believes you are prepared to assume greater responsibility. He has requested that you lead a project, which encompasses defining the business objective through to presenting your data-driven recommendations. He has asked you to rank the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 Index based on their fastest revenue growth, along with their total EBITDA and trading volume. He aims to evaluate the potential for implementing a new strategy within the fund called "Value Investing", specifically targeting stocks within industries perceived as undervalued in the current time period.

**Business Task**: Rank the top 10 quickest revenue growth companies, their total EBIDTA and trading volume.

**Deliverables**
1) I documented the whole process in R Studio with a R Markdown file which is executable (Knit) in a HTML format.
2) I used SQL Server Management Studio in order to manipulate the clean data with SQL queries.
3) Finaly i created a dynamic visualization dashboard with Power BI to present and explain my findings.
